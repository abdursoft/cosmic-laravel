                    <strong>Three worlds. Three obsessions.<br />Which will you surrender to first?</strong>

                    <p class="text-[19px] text-white">The art of control is never loud — it’s in the breath you hold, the
                        glance that lingers, the moment you realize you’ve already given in. In Obey, each page is a
                        slow surrender, every panel an unspoken command. You’ll find yourself leaning closer… just to
                        feel the next touch.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl text-red-500 italic">ARCANE'S OBESSION</h2>
                    <p class="text-[19px] text-white">Magic is powerful — but obsession is far more primal. In Arcane’s
                        Obsession, lust is laced with power, and every ritual binds more than the body. Here, pleasure
                        isn’t offered. It’s taken. And once the spell is cast, you’ll beg for the darkness to claim you.

                    <p class="text-[19px] text-white">Rope doesn’t just hold — it speaks. In Bound, every knot is a
                        sentence, every tug a declaration, every release a promise. This is where restraint becomes an
                        art form, and your body becomes the canvas. Step inside… and let the lines tell your story.</p>
